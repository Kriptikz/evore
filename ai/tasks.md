### Task 25: Dashboard TUI
**Priority:** 🔴 High

Get the ratatui dashboard working with proper layout.

**Important:** TUI is **monitoring-only**. Bots deploy automatically based on config file parameters. TUI does not control deployments - it displays real-time state from shared services.

**Layout (see plan.md for ASCII mockup):**
1. **Header** - Round, slot, phase, blockhash
2. **Bot Blocks** - One per bot with icon, config, status, rewards
3. **Board Grid** - 5x5 with totals + bot deployment overlay
4. **Transaction Log** - Scrollable with error details

**Subtasks:**

*Phase 1: Fix Existing*
- [ ] Review existing code in `bot/src/tui.rs`
- [ ] Fix any issues with current implementation
- [ ] Understand ratatui layout system

*Phase 2: Header Section*
- [ ] Round ID, slot, end_slot, slots_left
- [ ] Round phase (Active, Intermission, Waiting Reset, Waiting Start)
- [ ] Blockhash (truncated), RPC name

*Phase 3: Bot Blocks*
- [ ] Strategy-based icons:
  - EV: 📊 📈 💹 🎰 🎲
  - Percentage: 📐 🔢 🎯 ％
  - Manual: ✋ 🎮 🕹️ 👆
  - Multiple same strategy: add number (📊₁ 📊₂)
- [ ] Auth ID, strategy, bankroll
- [ ] Status with countdown
- [ ] **This round: total_deployed amount**
- [ ] **Claimable: SOL + ORE rewards**
- [ ] **Session stats section** (see Phase 7)

*Phase 4: Board Grid*
- [ ] 5x5 grid layout
- [ ] Total deployed per square (from Round account)
- [ ] Each bot shown separately: icon + their amount
- [ ] Multiple bots on same square = each on own line
- [ ] Color coding by amount

*Phase 5: Transaction Log*
- [ ] Scrollable log widget
- [ ] Timestamp, bot icon, action, signature
- [ ] **Error details for failed txs**

*Phase 6: Error Inspection*
- [ ] Fetch transaction error from RPC when status is failed
- [ ] Parse error into human-readable message
- [ ] Display: "EndSlotExceeded", "TooManySlotsLeft", "NoDeployments", etc.

*Phase 7: Session Statistics (In-Memory)*

Track stats in RAM, no extra RPC calls, resets on restart.

```rust
struct SessionStats {
    started_at: Instant,
}

struct BotSessionStats {
    started_at: Instant,
    rounds_participated: u64,
    rounds_won: u64,
    sol_earned: u64,
    ore_earned: u64,
    last_rewards_sol: u64,  // Before checkpoint
    last_rewards_ore: u64,  // Before checkpoint
}
```

- [ ] Create `SessionStats` struct (global session duration)
- [ ] Create `BotSessionStats` struct (per-bot stats)
- [ ] Increment `rounds_participated` on successful deploy
- [ ] Before checkpoint: store `last_rewards_sol` and `last_rewards_ore`
- [ ] After checkpoint: calculate delta and add to `sol_earned` / `ore_earned`
- [ ] Increment `rounds_won` when either reward increased
- [ ] Display in bot block: time running, rounds, wins (%), earned SOL + ORE

**Key ratatui concepts to learn:**
- `Frame`, `Rect` for layout
- `Block`, `Paragraph`, `Table` widgets
- `Layout::default().constraints()` for splitting areas
- `Stylize` trait for colors

### Task 26: Multi-Bot Architecture Refactor
**Priority:** 🔴 High

Refactor bot to support multiple parallel bots with shared services and optimized RPC.

See `plan.md` Phase 11 for full architecture diagrams and details.

---

#### Phase 11a: Shared Services

**Task 26a: BoardTracker**
- Websocket `accountSubscribe` to Board PDA
- Provides: `round_id`, `start_slot`, `end_slot`
- Detects new round started, round ended

**Task 26b: RoundTracker**
- Websocket `accountSubscribe` to current Round PDA
- Provides: `deployed[25]`, `total_deployed`
- Switches subscription when `round_id` changes

**Task 26c: BlockhashCache**
- Periodic RPC fetch (2s normally, 500ms when slots_left < 10)
- Shared via Arc

---

#### Phase 11b: Transaction Pipeline

**Task 26d: TxSender Task**
- Reads from mpsc channel
- Sends instantly (no blocking)
- Queues signature for confirmation

**Task 26e: TxConfirmer Task**
- Collects pending signatures
- Batch `getSignatureStatuses` (up to 256 per call)
- **Fetch transaction error details for failed txs**
- Parse errors into human-readable messages
- Returns `TxResult { signature, status, error, slot_landed }` via oneshot

---

#### Phase 11c: Bot Refactor

**Task 26f: BotConfig Struct**
```rust
struct BotConfig {
    name: String,
    auth_id: u64,
    strategy: DeployStrategy,
    slots_left: u64,
    bankroll: u64,
    strategy_params: StrategyParams,
}
```

**Task 26g: BotState Struct**
```rust
struct BotState {
    config: BotConfig,
    state: BotPhase,  // Idle, Waiting, Deploying, Deployed, Checkpointing
    last_deployed_round: Option<u64>,
    last_checkpointed_round: Option<u64>,
    pending_signatures: Vec<Signature>,
}
```

**Task 26h: Refactor Bot to Use Shared Services**
- Bot receives trackers via Arc
- Bot sends txs via mpsc channel
- Bot receives confirmations via oneshot

---

#### Phase 11d: Multi-Bot Coordination

**Task 26i: RoundCoordinator**
- Holds all bots + shared services
- Main loop checks round lifecycle
- Triggers checkpoint/claim when new round starts
- Triggers deploy when slots_left threshold reached

**Task 26j: Multi-Bot Spawning**
- Load bot configs from file or CLI
- Spawn each bot as async task
- All share same services via Arc

---

**Subtasks Summary:**
- [ ] 26a: BoardTracker (websocket, base64 decode account data)
- [ ] 26b: RoundTracker (websocket, switches on round change)
- [ ] 26c: BlockhashCache (periodic RPC)
- [ ] 26d: TxSender task (instant send)
- [ ] 26e: TxConfirmer task (batch status)
- [ ] 26f: BotConfig struct (with per-bot signer/manager paths)
- [ ] 26g: BotState struct + state machine
- [ ] 26h: Refactor bot to use shared services
- [ ] 26i: RoundCoordinator
- [ ] 26j: Multi-bot spawning from config
- [ ] 26k: Config file parsing (TOML format, see plan.md)
- [ ] 26l: Graceful shutdown (`Ctrl+C` handler)

**Note:** Consider migrating `SlotTracker` from `std::thread::spawn` to `tokio::spawn` for consistency with async architecture (not blocking, current approach works).
